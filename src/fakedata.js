Design is an essential characteristic of professional practice and requires unique knowledge, skills and attitudes common to a number of disciplines. In this unit, students will explore the process of design ideation, definition, prototyping and testing by working on authentic real world problems. The unit will allow students the opportunity to examine humanitarian problems in disadvantaged communities. Learning and assessment activities in this unit will require students to use creative processes to conceive, test and reflect on ideas. Students will be encouraged to view design problem from holistic and atomistic perspectives, paying attention to detail, and showing empathy for biases, values and needs of clients and users. Students will investigate design thinking and strategies, and modelling techniques to generate, evaluate and specify products in order to develop solutions to identified problems.",
